    "\n",
    "Candlesticks represent the price trajectory formed by the interaction between buyers and sellers during trading, essentially reflecting the path of capital flows. Investment decisions based solely on candlestick patterns are relatively limited. By integrating candlestick patterns with price-volume conditions, the accuracy of predictions and the success rate of investments can be significantly improved. This paper establishes an investment framework based on both candlestick pattern recognition and price-volume state identification.\n",

    "#### Candlestick Pattern and Price-Volume State Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "This study will primarily use the following candlestick features for pattern recognition: Bullish/Bearish (Yin & Yang) attribute, Body ratio, Upper Shadow ratio, Lower Shadow ratio, Returns, Open, High, Low, and Close prices. Regarding price-volume states, the most frequently occurring and widely used conditions are high volume and low volume, combined with the stock price being at a relative high or low level. To ensure broad applicability, this paper will use these two types of price-volume conditions to construct the identification framework."

    "Candlesticks are drawn based on the opening, highest, lowest, and closing prices of the analysis period. Taking the daily candlestick as an example, the section between the opening price and the closing price forms the candlestick's real body. If the closing price is higher than the opening price, it is called a bullish candlestick (Yang line), represented by a hollow (or red) body; conversely, it is called a bearish candlestick (Yin line), represented by a filled (or green) body. The line between the highest price and the real body is called the upper shadow, and the line between the lowest price and the real body is called the lower shadow.\n",

    "Effective candlestick patterns often originate from traders' long-term observation of candlesticks during trading. In practical application, the relative proportions of the real body, upper shadow, and lower shadow to the amplitude are closer to the actual observation perspective of traders and are more intuitive and convenient for candlestick pattern recognition. Therefore, we will use the relative proportions of the real body, upper shadow, and lower shadow to the amplitude to characterize the candlestick features of a stock, thereby completing candlestick pattern recognition.\n",

While simple bearish candles show weak effectiveness, ​gap-down bearish candles​ demonstrate stronger predictive power.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Probe Line pattern is a distinctive candlestick formation that reflects institutional testing and position consolidation. It typically appears during the mid-stage of market bottoms, the initial phase of uptrends, or during consolidation periods, indicating institutional attempts to test resistance levels and flush out weak holders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Details:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Both daily candlesticks are bullish (Yang);\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Current day's upper shadow ratio (Upper Shadow) ≥ 50%;\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Current day's lower shadow ratio (Lower Shadow) < 5%;\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Previous day's upper shadow ratio (Upper Shadow) < 25%;\n",

    "5) Previous day's lower shadow ratio (Lower Shadow) < 25%.\n",
